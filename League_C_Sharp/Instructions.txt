Modify file Program.cs:
	Change threadMillisecondSleepTime to slow down/speed up API calls.
	Change parameters for createMatchCSV to get desired results
		- make numMatches an extremely high number, as matchID's seem to skip hugely.
	startingMatchNumber specifies the first match we look at, then looks at the next numMatches matchID's
	change isMatchAcceptable function to filter out undesirable matches

Modify Matches.cs to change the attributes recorded into CSV by changing each ToString and getHeaderSection function
